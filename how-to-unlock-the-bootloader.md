## About
This article will guide you on how to unlock the Bootloader on your Android device, and is part of the [POCO F4 GT - Docs](README.md) project.

It's intended for begginers, and tested on a POCO F4 GT phone.

If you're new to unlocking the bootloader, please read the README section [Unlocking the Bootloader](README.md#unlocking-the-bootloader) to know more about Unlocking before continuing.

**Warning 1**: The unlock process **takes at least 7 days**, because that's the fixed time Xiaomi takes to give permission. Just be pacient. There are stories of people who tried to circumvent this period and had their waiting increased up to 60 days. Don't rush things.

**Warning 2**: All data will be wiped after the final step of the Bootloader unlock, and Android will reset to factory settings. This guide will remind you when it's time to backup important files, app data and accounts, and transfer banking apps to another device before continuing. Just keep this in mind.

**Warning 3**: This procedure can make your phone unbootable, if done incorrectly. Please, read all instructions carefully, and make sure to understand what you're doing. Take your time until you feel confident enough. Remember, you'll have 7 days to research and clarify doubts, and decide to proceed with the Unlocking.
